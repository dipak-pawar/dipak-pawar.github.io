Disk Partitioning allows you to divide hard drive into multiple logical sections. There are several reasons why we do it:\n Multi-boot OS Easier backup Different filesystems to be installed on different partitions Clear separation between operating system and user files  Partitioning Schemes MBR \u0026amp; GPT are two different schemes available to do partitions.\nMBR MBR supports maximum four primary partitions. On Linux, one can create more partitions having three primary \u0026amp; one extended partition which may contain multiple logical partitions.\nThe available size for block addresses and related information is limited to 32 bits. For hard disks with 512‑byte sectors, the MBR partition table entries allow a maximum size of 2 TiB (2^32 × 512‑bytes) or 2.20 TB (2.20 × 10¹² bytes).\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s world, we have physical disks greater than 2TiB in size, so MBR scheme having a maximum disk \u0026amp; partition size of 2TiB is really big problem, which is solved by GPT.\nGPT GPT addresses many of the limitations introduced by MBR \u0026amp; is Forming a part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface.\nGPT uses 64 bits for logical block addresses, allowing a maximum disk size of 2^64 sectors. For disks with 512‑byte sectors, the maximum size is 8 ZiB (2^64 × 512‑bytes) or 9.44 ZB (9.44 × 10^21 bytes).\nCreating Partitions We can create/manage partitions using parted, fdisk, gdisk. I\u0026rsquo;ll be using parted to play with partitions on USB drive.\nCreate GPT Partition Select disk to create partition\n# list devices [dipak@localhost ~]$ lsblk NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT sdb 8:16 1 14.9G 0 disk nvme0n1 259:0 0 953.9G 0 disk ├─nvme0n1p1 259:1 0 600M 0 part /boot/efi ├─nvme0n1p2 259:2 0 1G 0 part /boot └─nvme0n1p3 259:3 0 952.3G 0 part ├─fedora_localhost--live-root 253:0 0 70G 0 lvm │ └─luks-493fecbb-ff12-452a-914d-33f64d65e942 253:2 0 70G 0 crypt / ├─fedora_localhost--live-swap 253:1 0 19.5G 0 lvm │ └─luks-db8bdc6b-1e43-4074-89ca-1b412c35bc04 253:3 0 19.5G 0 crypt [SWAP] └─fedora_localhost--live-home 253:4 0 862.8G 0 lvm └─luks-c863fba7-ff0b-4896-9fcc-2e6144fccda4 253:5 0 862.8G 0 crypt /home # check current partition table [dipak@localhost ~]$ sudo parted /dev/sdb print Error: /dev/sdb: unrecognised disk label Model: Innostor Innostor (scsi) Disk /dev/sdb: 15.9GB Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B Partition Table: unknown Disk Flags: As you can see from above output, we don\u0026rsquo;t have any partition table on sdb device.\nCreate gpt partition of around 10 GiB.\n# create new disklabel `gpt`.
